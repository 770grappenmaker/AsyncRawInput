# Async Raw Input (Weave)
Weave Mod that asynchronously polls mouse input, which might reduce stutters and lost
inputs (as it did for me). Particularly useful for mice with a high polling
rate. 

### Installing
1. Download [Weave Loader](https://github.com/Weave-MC/Weave-Loader/releases) (v1.0.0-b.2 or newer).
2. Place `async-raw-input-0.1-mapped.jar` in `.weave/mods/1.8.9`.
3. Launch Weave using a tool of choice, like [Weave Manager](https://github.com/exejar/Weave-Manager).

### Usage
The mod activates automatically and has no client-side functionality other than amending the default input handler.
